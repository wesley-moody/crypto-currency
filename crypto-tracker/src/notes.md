1. Overall, I think labs was a positive experience for the team.
2. Team completed the emoji feedback feature, which is super dope b/c it was a greenfield component.
3. The ghost users feature is so close but ultimately don't think it'll be finished by end of labs.
4. I think they'll meet MVP.
5. Biggest blockers have been mentally wrapping their heads around the large scope with relatively short time frame. Getting past that and just starting on the work.
6. Don't think there's a need to zoom. 
BONUS: I have instructed the team, if they can't finish their components today, to begin focusing on good inline comments and creating a new section in the repo's readme for "Known Bugs" or "Work in Progress". The feeling is that we really DO want to set the next team up for success.
